    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>If you can make boxed macaroni and cheese, 
        you can make this one-pan, scratch-made mac and cheese! 
        The bacon, chives, and crispy bread crumb topping add 
        some great extra flavor and texture.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroli</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup margarine</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded white cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup real bacon bits</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon smipped chives</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</li>
        <li>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
